# hello-world
Github guide repo.

Hi my name is Rithvik Gujjula.  I am just starting out as a developer on Github.  This is my first ever repo. so there's nothing interesting in here.  I am using the Github guide to make this.  I am going to add some real code and get into coding for Goldman Sachs Alloy which is an open source modeling data platform.
